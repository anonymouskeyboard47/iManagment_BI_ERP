# iManagment_BI_ERP
This is an old ERP/BI system implementation that was implemented by the developer for the company Tripodsystems LTD, Kenya. The code is in visual studio 6 (Visual Basic). The work started in 2004, and this work has grown to produce Shambamap and Tripodmaps.

The classes are SOLID/AGILE like development with each object and extension defined properly in order to ensure a proper structure of the system.

you can download the code and use it as you with. email the developer if you think you want more, but you can easily add more.

If you are new to software engineering, GIS development, EPR/BI development, etc this is a good place to start in order to understand how financial, business, and other core systems work and interact with each other.

The system code is useful for:
- Land Management and Administration
- Document Management and Archiving
- Workflow Management
- Generating code automatically 
- Invoicing
- Chart of Accounts
- Accounting
- Building Management
- G.I.S web system
- Asset management (land as the core base)
- Tracking vehicles (better in Tripodmaps and Shambamap)

The system introduces the concept of land as the base of any moveable object, workflows, document and content management, etc. You may decide to build your entire ERP, CMS, G.I.S project, or code generator from scratch using this. This is not similar to having so,ething like EPiServer or Sharepoint, not similar to Visual Studio, not similar to Sage. This only forms the building blocks for such a system. You will need almost a year and several serious developers to convert this set of code into a functional CMS like EPiServer, but at least you will have a starting point. Polymorphism needs to be checked. But if you are making a cudtom system for a law firm, a G.I.S system for a land registry, a car tracking system, etc you are almost half way done with this code.

This code was superseded by the .NET version of iManagement that was later used to build Tripodmaps, iManagement.NET, and other platforms. iManagement.NET is written in C#.NET.
