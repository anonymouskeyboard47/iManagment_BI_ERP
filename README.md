# iManagment_BI_ERP
This is an old ERP/BI system implementation that was implemented by the developer for the company Tripodsystems LTD, Kenya. The code is in visual studio 6 (Visual Basic). The work started in 2004, and this work has grown to produce Shambamap and Tripodmaps. The code from Visual Basic 6 was converted by Visual Studio .NET by .NET's automatic concertor and therefore the classes are still in VB6 style format and not true .NET classes. The classes need a little .NETting to make them fully Object Oriented (e.g Polymorphism).

The classes are SOLID/AGILE like development classes, with each object and extension defined properly in order to ensure a proper structure of the system.

You can download the code and use it as you with. Email the developer if you want more, but you can easily add more on your own or hire a developer.

If you are new to software engineering, GIS development, EPR/BI development, etc this is a good place to start in order to understand how financial, business, and other core systems work and interact with each other.

The system code is useful for:
- Land Management and Administration
- Management of Government Services that relate to billing
- Document Management and Archiving
- Workflow Management (Business Processes and Business Functions and User Roles define the Workflow management)
- Generating code automatically 
- Invoicing
- Chart of Accounts
- Accounting
- Building Management (large scale because Assets use land as the base for integrating to the system)
- G.I.S web system
- Asset management (land as the core base)
- Tracking vehicles (better in Tripodmaps and Shambamap and land is used as the base for integrating to the system)

The system introduces the concept of land as the base of any moveable object, workflows, document and content management, etc. You may decide to build your entire ERP, CMS, G.I.S project, or code generator from scratch using this. This is not similar to having so,ething like EPiServer or Sharepoint, not similar to Visual Studio, not similar to Sage. This only forms the building blocks for such a system. You will need almost a year and several serious developers to convert this set of code into a functional CMS like EPiServer, but at least you will have a starting point. Polymorphism needs to be checked. But if you are making a custom system for a law firm, a G.I.S system for a land registry, a car tracking system, etc you are almost half way done with this code.

This code was superseded by the .NET version of iManagement known as TRIP_API that was later used to build Tripodmaps and other platforms. TRIP_API is written in C#.NET.


Work to do for the future
--------------------------
- NONE. This component is deprecated. However, TRIP_API's documentation lists different ideas and unfinished work that needs to be done in the future.

It should however be noted that error handling and security are major issues to address when using these components. Error handling within these components is practically inexistent.
