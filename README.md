# iManagment_BI_ERP
This is an old ERP/BI system implementation that was implemented by the developer for the company Tripodsystems LTD, Kenya. The code is in visual studio 6 (Visual Basic).

The classes are SOLID/AGILE like development with each object and extension defined properly in order to ensure a proper structure of the system.

you can download the code and use it as you with. email the developer if you think you want more, but you can easily add more.

If you are new to software engineering, GIS development, EPR/BI development, etc this is a good place to start in order to understand how financial, business, and other core systems work and interact with each other.

This code was superseded by the .NET version of iManagement that was later used to build Tripodmaps, iManagement.NET, and other platforms. iManagement.NET is written in C#.NET.
